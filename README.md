Command Central is basically a massive extension of the python module paramiko. Paramiko allows one to login and execute commands over ssh to machines. My module allows one to fully automate task including configuring, updating, and installing of software without needing any of those pesky agents being installed. This project is currently in undergoing a large re-write to make pieces as re-useable as possible. The goal is to have this module be ran and managed by either cronjobs or a jenkins build server.
